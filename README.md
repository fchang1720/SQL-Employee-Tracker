# SQL-Employee-Tracker

For this project, I created an application that helps track employees through mysql. Through a command prompt, a user can execute a variety of functions. Upon selecting view employees, roles, or departments, tables that list information about them will be displayed. The user can also add new employees, roles, or departments as well as update existing roles for current employees. You can find the GitHub repo here: https://github.com/fchang1720/SQL-Employee-Tracker

Additionally, a walkthrough video demonstrating its functions can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vXQMpSJ0P9H6lNx0tBX2mHSJmxc4girE/view
